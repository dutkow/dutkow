- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dutkow
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game development and have been working on growing my skills with the Unreal Engine.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to program more in C++ as I am interested in obtaining a foundation skillset in the language before I start programming using Unreal's libraries too much to avoid confusion.
